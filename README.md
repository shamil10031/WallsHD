# WallsHD-2018
**Wallpaper App**

The app works through the VK API based on the following principles:
- Albums are created in a private VK group.
- Each album is assigned a unique avatar and name.
- Each album is filled with photos.
- A high-resolution version of each photo is attached in the comments.
- In the app, albums are displayed as wallpaper categories.
- The name and avatar of each category are taken from the corresponding album data.
- The wallpapers for each category are sourced from the respective album and displayed in the app.
- When a wallpaper is opened in full-screen mode, the app loads the high-resolution photo from the comment attached to the corresponding album photo.
